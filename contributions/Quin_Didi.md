My name is Ihetu Chimdinma Adaugo (Quin_Didi on slack) a product designer, I'm a member of Team 44 and I carried out the following for my team

I worked on the splitting and saving Lo-fi(https://www.figma.com/file/mURSGFsm0Hx7tTKxTL6Kbw/(control-version)-PROJECT_TEAM_44-CHUNK_FILES-PROJECT-LIBRARY-Team-version?node-id=1045%3A1680)
I also designed the toggle for the dark and light modes, prototyped the light and dark mode for the pre-authorized section and the filled input field sections.(https://www.figma.com/file/mURSGFsm0Hx7tTKxTL6Kbw/(control-version)-PROJECT_TEAM_44-CHUNK_FILES-PROJECT-LIBRARY-Team-version?node-id=1045%3A1680)
I also designed the Landing page with a team member and prototyped the pre-authorised section (https://www.figma.com/file/mURSGFsm0Hx7tTKxTL6Kbw/(control-version)-PROJECT_TEAM_44-CHUNK_FILES-PROJECT-LIBRARY-Team-version?node-id=2509%3A21657)
I did a final correction and review of our final designs.
